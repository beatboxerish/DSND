# DSND

This is the repository for my Data Science Nanodegree projects from Udacity.
There are 2 projects currently and each folder contains their html files and .ipynb Jupyter notebooks along with any other files 
which are needed.

Finding_Donors_Supervised : I used supervised machine learning (classification) to find people who were most likely to be donors according to several publically available features from a dataset. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker. I performed grid search to tune the model and explored feature importance using the AdaBoostClassifier. 
                            
Image_Classifier : I used transfer learning to train a neural network to predict the species of a flower from 102 different flowers based on the image provided by the user. This was then turned into a command line application where different parameters can be changed and used to specify how to train and which neural network to use. Pytorch was used to develop the neural network. The argparse module was used to build the command line interface.

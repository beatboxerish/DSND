# Disaster Response Pipelines with Figure Eight

## About :

In this project, I have applied my data engineering skills to analyze disaster 
data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster 
messages. I learnt how to create an ETL and a machine learning pipeline to 
categorize messages sent during disaster events. These maybe then directed to,
according to the classified category, the appropriate disaster relief agency.

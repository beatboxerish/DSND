About this project : 

I worked with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution.
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.
I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, and then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

This folder contains two files : 

1) Identify_Customer_Segments.html : This is the html screenshot of the jupyter notebook used and is an alternative for going through the code.

2) Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb : This is the Jupyter notebook in which all the work has been done. 

Note: The data is not provided as the data I used was private and I was legally obliged to delete the data in 2 weeks from the completion of this project.

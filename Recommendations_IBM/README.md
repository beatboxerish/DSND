# Recommendations IBM

### About : 

I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and made 3 recommendation models to recommend 
new articles to them. I used a ranking based approach, a collaborative filtering approach and a machine learning approach.
Your project is divided into the following tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

2. Rank Based Recommendations

3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

4. Content Based Recommendations (Have not implemented this)

5. Matrix Factorization

### Files :

1. Recommendations_with_IBM.html : This is the html screenshot of the jupyter notebook 'Recommendations_with_IBM' and contains all the code 
with its output.

2. Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb : The jupyter notebook where all the coding has been done.

3. project_tests.py : Some tests written by udacity to check the answers to the questions in Recommendation_with_IBM.ipynb.

4. top_10.p, top_20.p, top_5.p : Python pickle files for tests used in the notebook.

5. user_item_matrix.p : Python pickle file providing data used in making the recommendation model.

# Finding Donors (Supervised)

### About : 

I used supervised machine learning (classification) to find people who were most likely to be donors according to several publically available features from a dataset. The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker. I performed grid search to tune the model and explored feature importance using the AdaBoostClassifier. 

### Files :

1. census.csv : Contains the data which we have used for this project. This is an editted version of the actual data and all rows with missing values have been removed. 

2. data_info : Contains all information about the original data from which census.csv has been obtained.

3. finding_donors(html).html : Is the screenshot of the Jupyter Notebook used. This is given as an easy alternative to go through the Jupyter Notebook's code.

4. finding_donors.ipynb : Is the Jupyter Notebook in which all the code is contained.

5. visuals.py : Package for visualizations made in finding_donors.ipynb.
